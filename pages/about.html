			Hey there! I am Prakhar. I am a Software Engineer and a Full-stack developer with a passion for CREATING and BUILDING simple tools that help simple people like you and I to optimize our lives and work on things that matter and move us forward. I believe every challenge is an opportunity for us to come out better and stronger. We must use every single day to hunt down these challenges and use them as opprtunities to solve problems.

			I take pride in belonging to Varanasi, India, more popularly known as Benares or Kashi. It is believed to be the holiest city in the world. It sits on the bank of river Ganges and as quoted by Mark Twain, "Benares is older than history, older even than legends and looks twice as old as all of them put together."

			Another Interesting fact, Buddha founded Buddhism in my hometown around 528 BCE. 
			<br><br>
			Here, Feast your eyes with a glimpse of Benares!

		<div class="tech-logo"><img src="../images/logo3.png" alt="Michigan Tech"></div>
		<p>
			I consider myself fortunate to be an alumni of Michigan Tech. It is a prestigious institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was on the 2017 Forbes list of top 25 STEM colleges in the U.S. More than a college it was my second home 7 oceans away from home. Mere words are not enough to describe the Utopia I lived in for 4.5 years. Life was crazy at Tech., I was surrounded by brilliant and passionate people all the time. Summers and Falls were as colorful as a rainbow and the Winters and Springs were cold and blizzardy. It was hard to leave after I graduated, but I am glad to say I moved on to the next phase of my life with beautiful memories from Michigan Tech.

			<h3>Important LIFE LESSONS that I have gathered from my college days</h3>
			<br>
			<ol>
				<li>Prioritize Learning Experience and the result will follow (GPA in this case)</li>

				<li>Accept failures quickly and move on</li> 

				<li>Collaboration is MUST, we as creators cannot accomplish everything as a one-man army</li>

				<li>Mentors are an integral part of growth in any endeavor, find them online, through books,
				   in-person and learn from their successes and failures</li>

				<li>Have goals with set intentions, planning and execution. Biggest of all "take action!"</li>

		<h1>My Passions</h1>

		<p>
			Fitness is one of my biggest passions along with technology, coding and self-improvement. Let me tell you a little
			story of a life-changing transformation that I experienced, which made me fall in mad-love with fitness
			and training. Due to an unfortunate event I suffered a lower-back injury in the year 2011. Two of my
			lower discs at the L4-L5 level suffered massive trauma that caused major lower-body immobility. It became
			impossible for me to walk, sit or bend down without immense lower back pain. These were the exact words
			of my doctor when they looked at my MRI, "Your spine looks like it belongs to a person who is atleast 50
			years old." I was put on complete bed rest for a few months. After consulting with several Neuro-Surgeons I went in for a surgery dead scared thinking if I would ever be able to walk without pain again. I still remember feeling embarassed when I was taken to New Delhi for my surgery and had to go around the airport in a wheel chair.

			<h4 class="card-content">I couldn't recognize the person I had become after the injury</h4>
		</div>

		<p>
			The whole incident took away 2 years of my life that 
			were spent in depression, pain, surgery, physiotherapy and getting back on my feet.
			I decided that I had to turn my life around and never let something like this wither my life again.
			I dedicated my life to research and training to get my strength back. In a few years what had started with 
			a simple goal turned into a never ending obsession of self-improvement.
			I fell in love with challenging myself day in and day out to learn and apply new techniques and
			training routines not just in fitness but life in general. I have come a long way since my 
			injury and am proud of what I have achieved so far.

			<h4 class="card-content">A better version of myself</h4>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Future Endevaours and Goals</h3>
		<p>
			I believe my injury was a blessing in disguise that helped me create a better and more passionate
			life for myself. I have learned a lot along the way and I want to use my story as an example and 
			inspire others who might be in similar situations as I was a few years ago. I want 
			to communicate to people the power of self-belief and a desire for better life regardless of your past.
		</p>

		<h3>Online Educational Platform for Fitness, Nutrition and Injury-Rehab</h3>

		<p>
			I have set my eyes on new goals of transforming the fitness industry with my curiosity, ideas, and technical skills. I want to create an online educational platform that houses different
			courses on training routines such as Weight Training, Calisthenics, Martial Arts, etc. There 
			will also be courses on Nutrition, Supplementation and Injury-Rehabilitation. I want to network with  
			an elite group of indviduals with expertise in different areas of fitness and athletics 
			and share their knowledge with the world 
			in the form of video tutorials packaged into courses. 
		</p>

		<h3>Cooking and future vision of establsihing a Nutrition Brand</h3>
		<p>
			I cook with all my heart. I believe that nutrition is a subject of major focus when it comes to fitness.
			I enjoy researching nutrition and diet routines to maintain a healthy lifestyle without having
			to give up on the desserts and mouth-watering foods we all love to indulge in.
			I love transforming comfort foods into protein-packed healthy meals. I want to establish a nutrition 
			brand that will research and create products that will be both nutritious and delicious. This brand will 
			be targeted towards improving peoples' lifestyles without making nutrition a frustrating task.
