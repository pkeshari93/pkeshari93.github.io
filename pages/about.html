			Hey there! I am Prakhar. I am a Software Engineer and a Full-stack developer with a passion for CREATING and BUILDING simple tools that help simple people like you and I to optimize our lives and work on things that matter and move us forward. I beleieve every challenge is an opportunity to come out better and stronger and we must use every single day to hunt down these challenges and work on them to solve problems.

		<p>
			I take pride in belonging from Varanasi, India, more popularly known as Benares or Kashi. If you didn't know it is believed to be the holiest city in the world. It sits on the bank of river Ganges and as quoted by Mark Twain, "Benares is older than history, older even than legends and looks twice as old as all of them put together."

			Another Interesting fact, Buddha founded Buddhism in my hometown around 528 BCE. 
			<br><br>
			Here, Feast your eyes with a glimpse of Benares!

		<h1>Got Schooled!</h1>

		<div class="tech-logo"><img src="../images/logo3.png" alt="Michigan Tech"></div>
		<p>
			I consider myself fortunate to be an alum of Michigan Tech. It is a prestigious institution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It was on the 2017 Forbes list of top 25 STEM colleges in the U.S. More than a college it was my home 7 oceans away from home. Words are hard to describe the Utopia I lived in for 4.5 years. Life was crazy at Tech. being surrounded by brilliant, passionate students and faculty. Summers and falls were as colorful as a rainbow and the winters and springs were cold and blizzardy with over 200 inches of snow that we received in Houghton every year. It was hard to leave after I graduated, but I am glad to say I moved on to the next phase of my life with beautiful memories from Michigan Tech.

		<h1>My passions</h1>

		<p>
			Fitness is one of my biggest passions along with technology, coding and self-improvement. Let me tell you a little
			story of a life-changing transformation that I experienced which made me fall in mad-love with fitness
			and training. Due to an unfortunate event I suffered a lower-back injury in the year 2011. Two of my
			lower discs at the L4-L5 level suffered massive trauma that caused major lower-body immobility. It became
			impossible for me to walk, sit or bend down without immense lower back pain. These were the exact words
			of my doctor when they looked at my MRI, "Your spine looks like it belongs to a person who is atleast 50
			years old." I was put on complete bed rest for a few months. After this I went in for a surgery dead scared
			thinking if I would ever be able to walk without pain again. I still remember being embarassed when I was
			taken to New Delhi for my surgery and had to go to around the airport, etc. in a wheel chair. 
		</p>

			<img src="../images/post-injury.jpg" alt="">
			<h4 class="card-content">I couldn't recognize the person I had become after injury</h4>
		</div>

		<p>
			This whole incident took away 2 years of my life that 
			were spent in depression, pain, surgery, physiotherapy and getting back on my feet.
			I decided that I had to turn my life around and never let something like this happen to me again.
			I dedicated my life to research and training to get my strength back. In a few years what had started with 
			a simple goal turned into a never ending obsession of self-improvement.
			I fell in love with challenging myself day in and day out to learn and apply new techniques and
			training routines not just in fitness but in life in general. I have come a long way since my 
			injury and proud of what I have achieved so far.

			<h4 class="card-content">A better version of myself</h4>
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3>Future endevaours and goals</h3>
		<p>
			I believe my injury was a blessing in disguise that helped me create a better and more passionate
			life for myself. I have learned a lot on the way and I want to use my story as an example and 
			inspire others who might be in similar situation as I was during my injury and depression. I want 
			to communicate to people what can be achieved with self-beleief and a want for better life 
			no matter what your past was like.
		</p>

		<h3>Online educational platform for Fitness, Nutrition and Injury-rehab</h3>

		<p>
			I have set my eyes on new goals of transforming the fitness industry with my technical skills,
			curiosity and ideas. I want to create an online educational platform that houses in one place different
			courses on training routines such as Weight Training, Calisthenics, Martial Arts, etc. There 
			will also be courses on nutrition, supplementation and injury-rehabilitation. I want to network with  
			and gather an elite group of indviduals with expertise in different areas of fitness and athletics 
			such as weight training, calisthenics, martial arts etc. and share their knowledge with the world 
			in the form of video tutorials packaged together into courses. 
		</p>

		<h3>Cooking and future vision of establsihing a Nutrition brand</h3>
		<p>
			I cook with all my heart. I believe that nutrition is a subject of major focus when it comes to fitness.
			I enjoy researching nutrition and diet routines to maintain a healthy lifestyle without having
			to give up on the desserts and mouth-watering foods we all love to indulge in.
			I love transforming comfort foods into protein-packed healthy meals.
